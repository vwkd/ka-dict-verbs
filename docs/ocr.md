# Steps



## Preparation

- DJVU to images (TIFF?)
- discard images
  - discard introduction
  - discard empty pages
- categorize images
  - abbreviations
  - dictionary pages
  - verb summaries



## Scan

- maybe train OCR on characters, e.g. 1 and l, cursive m f n, etc.
- OCR scan for each category
  - preserve indent



## Postprocessing

- do checks
  - words are in alphabetical order
  - entry is in numerical order, has semicolon everywhere, etc.
- find `[`, move to previous or following line



## Convert

- separate by numbers, then semicolons ?
